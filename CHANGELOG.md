# Change Log

## [v1.3.0]

* Added `Powershell` and `nix` host languages (thanks to [@DaRacci](https://github.com/DaRacci) for the contributions)



## [v1.2.0]

* Added `TypeScript` as a host language, and `Handlebars` as an embedded language (thanks to [@AVor0n](https://github.com/AVor0n) for these additions)
* Loading the most popular Jinja extension no longer disables syntax highlighting in YAML files (Issue [#1](https://github.com/ruschaaf/extended-embedded-languages/issues/1))
* Updated docs


## [v1.1.1]

Updated package description, it was too long

## [v1.1.0]
Added Rust and Go as host languages



## [v1.0.0]

Added embedded languages: Lua, Makefile, GraphQL, TypeScript, LaTeX,
TeX, and Graphviz

Added experimental generation of embedded langauge snippets - these are
not added to VSCode by default yet, but they could be manually added to
a project. If you
can use the `sql` snippet and depending on the host language you might
get
```cpp
//c++
R"sql(
)sql"
```
or 
```py
#python
"""--sql
"""
```

Clarified "snippets" vs. "examples" in the code

## [v0.0.2]

New host language: JavaScript

New embedded languages: hlsl, glsl, wgsl, Metal

Refactored code and added ESLint for linting

Regexp improvements for better matching
